# Note-Taker
 Week-11 Challenge (express.js): This application was designed to give users a place to store notes to help them organize their thoughts and to keep track of tasks they need to complete. It is powered by Express and JavaScript and implements an imitation database using a json file (db.json) to save and retrieve data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo.

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install express and uniqid directly from the command line, to do so the command for express will be npm i express to install the latests version of Express framework globally so that it can be used within the node terminal, and npm i uniqid to install the latest version of uniqid).

6. To run the server type the command npm start or node server.js in terminal.

7. Once server is running, users can access the front end of the application within the browser to observe full functionality of the site.


## Credits

Much of this application followed outline code found within the week 11 class activities (specifically mini project). Also, worked closely with peer Garrett, https://github.com/garrett-lieb/Note-Taker?tab=readme-ov-file.
